### **2. Cookbooks**

Create a small app to add to our cookbook to showcase your use case or innovative idea. 

> **Important** - Each app in the cookbook must have a *README*. We want to ensure that developers can easily use the cookbook

Cookbook apps can be in typescript or python. And, you can decide on whether to showcase it through as a *console app*, *ipython notebook*, etc.

#### **Examples:**
