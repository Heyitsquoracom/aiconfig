Just take it easy!' So when one of the young guys had his hand, one of the older two took it and he started going through the crowd, the other two were in a crowd like people walked up and down the steps.\n\nThey had taken something along the line and there was another guy in the crowd saying, 'You're a little different than our crowd,' and the others were walking up all the way down the steps. The man in the crowd was talking about the whole 'crowd control.' So when the young guy asked him where, when and how the crowd was being distributed by one group, he said, 'Come here. It's happening now",
