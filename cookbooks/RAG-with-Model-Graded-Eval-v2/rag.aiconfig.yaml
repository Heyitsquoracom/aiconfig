    context0: " New England open to neutrals.\nFrom that time nothing entered or left\
      \ the blockaded coast except swift\nprivateers, or occasional fast-sailing vessels\
      \ which risked capture\nin the attempt. Toward the close of the year Admiral\
      \ Warren extended\nhis blockade eastward. Notice of the extension was given\
      \ at Halifax\nNovember 16, and by the blockading squadron off New London December\
      \ 2,\nthus closing Long Island Sound to all vessels of every description.[381]\n\
      \nThe pressure of the blockade was immediately felt. In August[382]\nsuperfine\
      \ flour sold at Boston for $11.87 a barrel, at Baltimore for\n$6.00, and at\
      \ Richmond for $4.50. Upland cotton sold at Boston for\ntwenty cents a pound;\
      \ at Charleston for nine cents. Rice sold at\nPhiladelphia for $12.00 a hundred\
      \ weight; in Charleston and Savannah\nfor $3.00. Sugar sold in Boston for $18.75\
      \ a hundred weight; in\nBaltimore for $26.50. Already the American staples were\
      \ unsalable at\nthe places of their production. No rate of profit could cause\
      \ cotton,\nrice, or \nwheat to be brought by sea from Charleston or Norfolk\
      \ to\nBoston. Soon speculation began. The price of imported articles rose to\n\
      extravagant points. At the end of the year coffee sold for thirty-eight\ncents\
      \ a pound, after selling for twenty-one cents in August. Tea which\ncould be\
      \ bought for $1.70 per pound in August, sold for three and four\ndollars in\
      \ December. Sugar which was quoted at nine dollars a hundred\nweight in New\
      \ Orleans, and in August sold for twenty-one or twenty-two\ndollars in New York\
      \ and Philadelphia, stood at forty dollars in\nDecember.\n\nMore sweeping in\
      \ its effects on exports than on imports, the blockade\nrapidly reduced the\
      \ means of the people. After the summer of 1813,\nGeorgia alone, owing to its\
      \ contiguity with Florida, succeeded in\ncontinuing to send out cotton. The\
      \ exports of New York, which exceeded\n$12,250,000 in 1811, fell to $209,000\
      \ for the year ending in 1814. The\ndomestic exports of Virginia diminished\
      \ in four years from $4,800,000\nto $3,000,000 for 1812, $1,\nand supplied the\
      \ Union\nwith articles of necessary use at prices practically fixed by her own\n\
      manufacturers. From the whole country specie began to flow toward\nBoston as\
      \ early as the year 1810, and with astonishing rapidity after\nthe war was declared.\
      \ The British blockade stimulated the movement,\nand the embargo of December,\
      \ 1813, which lasted till April, 1814, cut\noff every other resource from the\
      \ Southern and Western States. Unable\nlonger to send their crops even to New\
      \ England for a market, they were\nobliged to send specie, and they soon came\
      \ to the end of their supply.\nThe Massachusetts banks, which reported about\
      \ $820,000 in specie in\n1809, returned more than $3,680,000 in June, 1812;\
      \ which rose to\n$5,780,000 in June, 1813, and reached nearly $7,000,000 in\
      \ June, 1814.\nIn five years the Massachusetts banks alone drew more than six\
      \ million\ndollars in specie from the Southern and Middle States,[478] besides\n\
      what they sent to Canada in payment for British bills.\n\nNo one knew how much\
      \ s\nn be given to it.\u201D\n\nAlthough Madison pointed to the notorious supply\
      \ of food for the\nBritish forces in Canada as one of the motives for imposing\
      \ an embargo,\nno one supposed that motive to be decisive. Other laws already\
      \ forbade\nand punished such communication with the enemy; and experience proved\n\
      that a general embargo would be no more effective than any special\nprohibition.\
      \ The idea that England could be distressed by an embargo\nseemed still less\
      \ likely to influence Government. Congress knew that\nRussia, Prussia, Denmark,\
      \ Sweden and Norway, Spain, and South America\nwere already open to English\
      \ commerce, and that a few days must decide\nwhether Napoleon could much longer\
      \ prevent Great Britain from trading\nwith France. The possibility of distressing\
      \ England by closing Boston\nand Salem, New Bedford and Newport to neutral ships\
      \ was not to be\nseriously treated.\n\nWhatever was the true motive of the President\u2019\
      s recommendation,\nCongress instantly approved it. The next day, December 10,\
      \ the Hou\nr was responsible,\nthe effect was ruinous. The New England banks\
      \ were financial agents\nof the enemy. The bank capital of Massachusetts including\
      \ Maine was\nabout twelve and a quarter million dollars; that of Connecticut\n\
      exceeded three millions. The whole bank capital of New England reached\neighteen\
      \ millions,[477] or nearly one third of the paid bank capital\nof the whole\
      \ country, if Pitkin\u2019s estimate was correct. That nearly\none third of\
      \ the national resources should be withdrawn from the aid\nof government was\
      \ serious enough; but in reality the loss was much\ngreater, for New England\
      \ held a still larger proportion of the specie\non which the bank circulation\
      \ of other States depended.\n\nThe system of commercial restrictions was responsible\
      \ for thus, at\nthe most critical moment of the war, throwing the control of\
      \ the\nnational finances into the hands of the Boston Federalists. Against\n\
      the protests of the Federalists, manufactures had been forced upon\nthem by\
      \ national legislation until New Engl\n17, 1813; Annals, 1813\u20131814, p.\
      \ 2781.\n"
    context1: " antic during the\nwinter months.\n\nWith it went the tale of Napoleon\u2019\
      s immense disaster. October 23 he\nbegan his retreat; November 23 he succeeded\
      \ in crossing the Beresina\nand escaping capture; December 5 he abandoned what\
      \ was still left of\nhis army; and December 19, after travelling secretly and\
      \ without rest\nacross Europe, he appeared suddenly in Paris, still powerful,\
      \ but in\ndanger. Nothing could be better calculated to support the Russian\n\
      mediation in the President\u2019s mind. The possibility of remaining without\n\
      a friend in the world while carrying on a war without hope of success,\ngave\
      \ to the Czar\u2019s friendship a value altogether new.\n\nOther news crossed\
      \ the ocean at the same time, but encouraged no hope\nthat England would give\
      \ way. First in importance, and not to be trifled\nwith, was the British official\
      \ announcement, dated December 26, 1812,\nof the blockade of the Chesapeake\
      \ and Delaware. Americans held that\nthis blockade was illegal,[18]--a blockade\
      \ of a coast, not of a port; a\npaper-\n the Indian signers to declare war on\
      \ the British.\nNeither Harrison\u2019s nor Jackson\u2019s treaty embraced the\
      \ chief body of\nhostile Indians; but Harrison\u2019s treaty served another\
      \ purpose of no\nsmall value in appearing to remove an obstacle to negotiation\
      \ with\nEngland.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\n\nBADLY as the United States fared\
      \ in the campaign of 1813, their\nsituation would have been easy had they not\
      \ suffered under the\nannoyances of a blockade continually becoming more stringent.\
      \ The\ndoctrine that coasts could be blockaded was enforced against America\n\
      with an energy that fell little short of demonstration. The summer was\nwell\
      \ advanced before the whole naval force to be used for the purpose\ncould be\
      \ posted at the proper stations. Not until May 26 did Admiral\nWarren issue\
      \ at Bermuda his proclamation of \u201Ca strict and rigorous\nblockade of the\
      \ ports and harbors of New York, Charleston, Port Royal,\nSavannah, and of the\
      \ river Mississippi,\u201D which completed the blockade\nof the coast, leaving\
      \ only the ports of \nblockade, one of the grievances against which the war\
      \ was waged;\nbut whatever they might choose to call it, they could not successfully\n\
      disprove its efficiency, or deny that it made Chesapeake Bay, Delaware\nRiver,\
      \ and the Vineyard Sound little better than British waters. Export\nof American\
      \ produce from the Chesapeake and Delaware ceased.\n\nThe blockade, though serious\
      \ beyond all other military measures,\nroused less attention and less protest\
      \ than another measure of the\nBritish government which had the character of\
      \ a profitable insult. A\ncircular dated November 9, addressed to the governors\
      \ of West Indian\ncolonies by the British government, authorized them to issue\
      \ licenses\nfor importation of necessary supplies during the war,--a precaution\n\
      commonly taken to meet the risk of famine in those regions. The\nGovernor of\
      \ the Bermudas, in issuing a proclamation January 14, 1813,\npublished the circular,\
      \ which contained one unusual provision:[19]--\n\n    \u201CWhatever importations\
      \ are proposed to be m\n nor any\nmeasures that could be taken by sea or land,\
      \ prevented a constant\ntraffic between Halifax and the New England ports not\
      \ blockaded. The\nUnited States government seemed afraid to interfere with it.\
      \ The\nnewspapers asserted that hundreds of Americans were actually in Halifax\n\
      carrying on a direct trade, and that thousands of barrels of flour were\nconstantly\
      \ arriving there from the United States in vessels carrying\nthe Swedish or\
      \ other neutral flag. In truth the government could do\nlittle to enforce its\
      \ non-intercourse, and even that little might prove\nmischievous. Nothing could\
      \ be worse than the spirit of the people on\nthe frontier. Engaged in a profitable\
      \ illicit commerce, they could only\nbe controlled by force, and any force not\
      \ overwhelming merely provoked\nviolence or treason. The Navy Department had\
      \ no vessels to send there,\nand could not have prevented their capture if vessels\
      \ in any number had\nbeen sent. The Secretary of War had abandoned to the State\
      \ governments\nthe defence \n ruining the peasantry. We drive all their cattle,\
      \ and of\ncourse ruin them. _My_ hands are clean; but it is hateful to see the\n\
      poor Yankees robbed, and to be the robber.\u201D\n\nCompared with the widespread\
      \ destruction which war brought on these\nregions half a century afterward,\
      \ the injury inflicted by the British\nnavy in 1813 was trifling, but it served\
      \ to annoy the Southern\npeople, who could offer no resistance, and were harassed\
      \ by incessant\nmilitia-calls. To some extent the same system of vexation was\
      \ pursued\non the Northern coast. The Delaware River was blockaded and its\n\
      shores much annoyed. New York was also blockaded, and Nantucket with\nthe adjacent\
      \ Sounds became a British naval station. There Sir Thomas\nHardy, Nelson\u2019\
      s favorite, officer, commanded, in his flag-ship the\n\u201CRamillies.\u201D\
      \ Hardy did not encourage marauding such as Cockburn\npractised, but his blockade\
      \ was still stringent, and its efficiency was\nproved by the failure of Decatur\u2019\
      s efforts to evade it.\n\nDecatur commanded a squad\ned States outside of New\
      \ England did\nnot exceed $150,000 a month, or at the rate of $1,800,000 a year.[384]\n\
      \nNo ordinary operations of war could affect the United States so\nseverely\
      \ as this inexorable blockade. Every citizen felt it in every\naction of his\
      \ life. The farmer grew crops which he could not sell,\nwhile he paid tenfold\
      \ prices for every necessity. While the country\nwas bursting with wealth, it\
      \ was ruined. The blockade was but a part\nof the evil. The whole coast was\
      \ systematically swept of the means of\nindustry. Especially the Virginians\
      \ and Marylanders felt the heavy hand\nof England as it was felt nowhere else\
      \ except on the Niagara River. A\nlarge British squadron occupied Chesapeake\
      \ Bay, and converted it into\na British naval station. After the month of February,\
      \ 1813, the coasts\nof Virginia and Maryland enjoyed not a moment\u2019s repose.\
      \ Considering the\nimmense naval power wielded by England, the Americans were\
      \ fortunate\nthat their chief losses were confined to the farm-yards and \n\
      n be given to it.\u201D\n\nAlthough Madison pointed to the notorious supply\
      \ of food for the\nBritish forces in Canada as one of the motives for imposing\
      \ an embargo,\nno one supposed that motive to be decisive. Other laws already\
      \ forbade\nand punished such communication with the enemy; and experience proved\n\
      that a general embargo would be no more effective than any special\nprohibition.\
      \ The idea that England could be distressed by an embargo\nseemed still less\
      \ likely to influence Government. Congress knew that\nRussia, Prussia, Denmark,\
      \ Sweden and Norway, Spain, and South America\nwere already open to English\
      \ commerce, and that a few days must decide\nwhether Napoleon could much longer\
      \ prevent Great Britain from trading\nwith France. The possibility of distressing\
      \ England by closing Boston\nand Salem, New Bedford and Newport to neutral ships\
      \ was not to be\nseriously treated.\n\nWhatever was the true motive of the President\u2019\
      s recommendation,\nCongress instantly approved it. The next day, December 10,\
      \ the Hou\nculty in obtaining it; but he would hardly have arranged a system\n\
      of signals as visible to Decatur as to himself. Even had he done so, he\nmight\
      \ have employed men in his own service as well as Americans for the\npurpose.\
      \ Decatur\u2019s letter admitted that he had made great exertions to\ndetect\
      \ the culprits, but without success.\n\nThe rigor of the British blockade extended\
      \ no farther north than\nthe Vineyard and Nantucket. Captain Broke in the \u201C\
      Shannon,\u201D with a\ncompanion frigate, cruised off Boston harbor rather to\
      \ watch for\nships-of-war than to interfere with neutral commerce. Along the\
      \ coast\nof Maine an illicit trade with the British provinces was so actively\n\
      pursued that one of the few American sloops-of-war, the \u201CEnterprise,\u201D\
      \ncruised there, holding smugglers, privateers, and petty marauders in\ncheck.\
      \ On no other portion of the coast would an armed national vessel\nhave been\
      \ allowed to show itself, but the \u201CEnterprise,\u201D protected\nby the\
      \ bays and inlets of Maine, and favored by the absence of a\nst India colonies\
      \ were kept in constant discomfort and starvation\nby swarms of semi-piratical\
      \ craft darting in and out of every channel\namong their islands; but the people\
      \ of England could have borne with\npatience the punishment of the West Indies\
      \ had not the American\ncruisers inflicted equally severe retribution nearer\
      \ home.\n\nGreat Britain was blockaded. No one could deny that manifest danger\n\
      existed to any merchant-vessel that entered or left British waters.\nDuring\
      \ the summer the blockade was continuous. Toward the close of\n1812 an American\
      \ named Preble, living in Paris, bought a small vessel,\nsaid to have belonged\
      \ in turn to the British and French navy, which\nhe fitted as a privateer-brig,\
      \ carrying sixteen guns and one hundred\nand sixty men. The \u201CTrue-Blooded\
      \ Yankee,\u201D commanded by Captain Hailey,\nsailed from Brest March 1, 1813,\
      \ and cruised thirty-seven days on\nthe coasts of Ireland and Scotland, capturing\
      \ twenty-seven valuable\nvessels; sinking coasters in the very bay of Dublin;\
      \ la\ntion that the secretary\nintended to throw upon them the whole responsibility\
      \ for the failure of\nan expedition which he as well as they knew to be hopeless.\n\
      \nDoubtless a vigorous general might still have found means if not to\ntake\
      \ Montreal, at least to compel the British to evacuate Upper Canada;\nbut Wilkinson\
      \ was naturally a weak man, and during the descent of the\nriver he was excessively\
      \ ill, never able to make a great exertion.\nEvery day his difficulties increased.\
      \ Hardly had his flotilla begun\nits descent, when a number of British gunboats\
      \ commanded by Captain\nMulcaster, the most energetic officer in the British\
      \ naval service\non the Lake, slipping through Chauncey\u2019s blockade, appeared\
      \ in\nWilkinson\u2019s rear, and caused him much annoyance. Eight hundred British\n\
      rank-and-file from Kingston and Prescott were with Mulcaster, and at\nevery\
      \ narrow pass of the river, musketry and artillery began to open\non Wilkinson\
      \ from the British bank. Progress became slow. November 7,\nMacomb was landed\
