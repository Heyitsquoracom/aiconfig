Dearborn protested that it was\\ndone without his knowledge and against his orders.[166]\\n\\nThe success cost far more than it was worth. The explosion of a powder\\nmagazine, near which the American advance halted, injured a large\\nnumber of men on both sides. Not less than three hundred and twenty\\nAmericans were killed or wounded in the battle or explosion,[167] or\\nabout one fifth of the entire force. General Pike, the best brigadier\\nthen in the service, was killed. Only two or three battles in the\\nentire war were equally bloody.[168] “Unfortunately the enemy’s armed\\nship the ‘Prince Regent,’” reported Dearborn,[169] “left this place for\\nKingston four days before we arrived.”\\n\\nChauncey and Dearborn crossed to Niagara, while the troops remained\\nsome ten days at York, and we\\nthought that\\nthe paid bank capital of the United States did not much exceed sixty\\nmillions,[476] and that the notes of these banks in circulation did not\\nreach thirty millions. His estimate of paid bank capital was probably\\nliberal, but his estimate of the circulation was eight or ten millions\\ntoo small. Had the Treasury been able to count on the use of these\\nresources, they might have answered all necessary purposes; but between\\nthe mistakes of the government and the divisions of the people, the\\nTreasury was left with no sound resources whatever.\\n\\nThe first and fatal blow to the Treasury was the loss of the Bank\\nof the United States, which left the government without financial\\nmachinery or a sound bank-note circulation. The next blow, almost\\nequally severe, was the loss of the Massachusetts and Connecticut\\nbanks, which were the strongest in the Union. Whether the\\nresponsibility for the loss rested on the Executive, Congress, or the\\ntwo States might be a subject for dispute; but whoeve\\nll possibility of exulting in our victories over such an\\nenemy.” The “Times” found in such reflections a reason for not exulting\\nin ministerial victories, but it bewailed defeats the more loudly,\\nand annoyed the Ministry by the violence of its attacks on naval\\nadministration.\\n\\nAs the year passed, and England’s triumph in Europe seemed to\\novershadow the world, the “Times,” probably recognizing the uselessness\\nof attacking the Ministry, showed worse temper toward the United\\nStates. The Americans were rarely mentioned, and always with language\\nof increasing ill humor. “Despicable in the cabinet, ridiculous in the\\nfield,”[461] the Americans disappeared from sight in the splendor of\\nvictory at Vittoria and Leipzig. No wish for peace was suggested, and\\nif the “Times” expressed the true feelings of the respectable middle\\nclass, as it was supposed to aim at doing, no wish for peace could be\\nsupposed to exist.\\n\\nOf the ministerial papers the “Courier” was the best, and of course was\\nemphatic in \\n for its object to dissolve the ties of\\n    allegiance and the sentiments of loyalty in the adversary nation,\\n    and to seduce and separate its component parts the one from the\\n    other.

      "The destruction of the Assembly houses, afterward alleged as ground\n",
      "for retaliation against the capitol at Washington, was probably the\n",
      "unauthorized act of private soldiers. Dearborn protested that it was\n",
      "done without his knowledge and against his orders.[166]\n",
      "\n",
      "The success cost far more than it was worth. The explosion of a powder\n",

      "number of men on both sides. Not less than three hundred and twenty\n",
      "Americans were killed or wounded in the battle or explosion,[167] or\n",
      "about one fifth of the entire force. General Pike, the best brigadier\n",
      "then in the service, was killed. Only two or three battles in the\n",
      "entire war were equally bloody.[168] “Unfortunately the enemy’s armed\n",

      "Chauncey and Dearborn crossed to Niagara, while the troops remained\n",

      "the paid bank capital of the United States did not much exceed sixty\n",
      "millions,[476] and that the notes of these banks in circulation did not\n",
      "reach thirty millions. His estimate of paid bank capital was probably\n",
      "liberal, but his estimate of the circulation was eight or ten millions\n",
      "too small. Had the Treasury been able to count on the use of these\n",
      "resources, they might have answered all necessary purposes; but between\n",
      "the mistakes of the government and the divisions of the people, the\n",
      "Treasury was left with no sound resources whatever.\n",

      "The first and fatal blow to the Treasury was the loss of the Bank\n",
      "of the United States, which left the government without financial\n",
      "machinery or a sound bank-note circulation. The next blow, almost\n",
      "equally severe, was the loss of the Massachusetts and Connecticut\n",
      "banks, which were the strongest in the Union. Whether the\n",
      "responsibility for the loss rested on the Executive, Congress, or the\n",
      "two States might be a subject for dispute; but whoeve\n",

      "administration.\n",

      "As the year passed, and England’s triumph in Europe seemed to\n",
      "overshadow the world, the “Times,” probably recognizing the uselessness\n",
      "of attacking the Ministry, showed worse temper toward the United\n",
      "States. The Americans were rarely mentioned, and always with language\n",
      "of increasing ill humor. “Despicable in the cabinet, ridiculous in the\n",
      "field,”[461] the Americans disappeared from sight in the splendor of\n",
      "victory at Vittoria and Leipzig. No wish for peace was suggested, and\n",
      "if the “Times” expressed the true feelings of the respectable middle\n",
      "class, as it was supposed to aim at doing, no wish for peace could be\n",
      "supposed to exist.\n",

      "\n",
      "Although many persons shared Madison’s view of war as a compulsory\n",
      "process of international law, Federalists and Republicans were at a\n",
      "loss to understand his view of “deformity” and “depravity” in modes\n",

      "destruction at the navy-yard was very great, and was sensibly felt.\n",
      "Such a succession of ill news could not but affect the Government.\n",
      "The repeated failures to destroy the British force at Niagara; the\n",
      "disasters of Chandler, Winder, and Boerstler; the narrow and partial\n",

      "Charles James Fox, Lord Grey, Jefferson, and Madison; but opposition\n",

Dearborn protested that it was\\ndone without his knowledge and against his orders.[166]\\n\\nThe success cost far more than it was worth. The explosion of a powder\\nmagazine, near which the American advance halted, injured a large\\nnumber of men on both sides. Not less than three hundred and twenty\\nAmericans were killed or wounded in the battle or explosion,[167] or\\nabout one fifth of the entire force. General Pike, the best brigadier\\nthen in the service, was killed. Only two or three battles in the\\nentire war were equally bloody.[168] “Unfortunately the enemy’s armed\\nship the ‘Prince Regent,’” reported Dearborn,[169] “left this place for\\nKingston four days before we arrived.”\\n\\nChauncey and Dearborn crossed to Niagara, while the troops remained\\nsome ten days at York, and we\\nthought that\\nthe paid bank capital of the United States did not much exceed sixty\\nmillions,[476] and that the notes of these banks in circulation did not\\nreach thirty millions. His estimate of paid bank capital was probably\\nliberal, but his estimate of the circulation was eight or ten millions\\ntoo small. Had the Treasury been able to count on the use of these\\nresources, they might have answered all necessary purposes; but between\\nthe mistakes of the government and the divisions of the people, the\\nTreasury was left with no sound resources whatever.\\n\\nThe first and fatal blow to the Treasury was the loss of the Bank\\nof the United States, which left the government without financial\\nmachinery or a sound bank-note circulation. The next blow, almost\\nequally severe, was the loss of the Massachusetts and Connecticut\\nbanks, which were the strongest in the Union. Whether the\\nresponsibility for the loss rested on the Executive, Congress, or the\\ntwo States might be a subject for dispute; but whoeve\\nll possibility of exulting in our victories over such an\\nenemy.” The “Times” found in such reflections a reason for not exulting\\nin ministerial victories, but it bewailed defeats the more loudly,\\nand annoyed the Ministry by the violence of its attacks on naval\\nadministration.\\n\\nAs the year passed, and England’s triumph in Europe seemed to\\novershadow the world, the “Times,” probably recognizing the uselessness\\nof attacking the Ministry, showed worse temper toward the United\\nStates. The Americans were rarely mentioned, and always with language\\nof increasing ill humor. “Despicable in the cabinet, ridiculous in the\\nfield,”[461] the Americans disappeared from sight in the splendor of\\nvictory at Vittoria and Leipzig. No wish for peace was suggested, and\\nif the “Times” expressed the true feelings of the respectable middle\\nclass, as it was supposed to aim at doing, no wish for peace could be\\nsupposed to exist.\\n\\nOf the ministerial papers the “Courier” was the best, and of course was\\nemphatic in \\n for its object to dissolve the ties of\\n    allegiance and the sentiments of loyalty in the adversary nation,\\n    and to seduce and separate its component parts the one from the\\n    other. The general tendency of these demoralizing and disorganizing\\n    contrivances will be reprobated by the civilized world.”\\n\\nAlthough many persons shared Madison’s view of war as a compulsory\\nprocess of international law, Federalists and Republicans were at a\\nloss to understand his view of “deformity” and “depravity” in modes\\nof warfare. The whole truth in regard to West and East Florida was\\nnot known, but so much was notorious, even in 1811, as to warrant the\\nBritish minister in protesting “against an attempt so contrary to every\\nprinciple of public justice, faith, and national honor.”[20] What the\\nUnited States could do in Florida in time of peace, England could\\nsurely do in Massachusetts in time of war; but if England’s conduct\\nwas in reality deformed and depraved, as charged, the celebrated\\nproclam\\neven more severe; and the total loss in an aggregate which\\ncould hardly have numbered much more than eight hundred and fifty men\\nall told, amounted to two hundred and fifty-nine killed, wounded, and\\nmissing, leaving Prevost less than six hundred men to escape,[207] in\\nthe face of twice their numbers and under the fire of heavy guns.[208]\\n\\nThe British attack was repulsed, and Jacob Brown received much credit\\nas well as a commission of brigadier-general in the United States\\narmy for his success; but the injury inflicted by the premature\\ndestruction at the navy-yard was very great, and was sensibly felt.\\nSuch a succession of ill news could not but affect the Government.\\nThe repeated failures to destroy the British force at Niagara; the\\ndisasters of Chandler, Winder, and Boerstler; the narrow and partial\\nescape of Sackett’s Harbor; the total incapacity of Dearborn caused\\nby fever and mortification,--all these evils were not the only or the\\ngreatest subjects for complaint.

      ", including the houses of Assembly, were burned.\n",
      "The destruction of the Assembly houses, afterward alleged as ground\n",
      "for retaliation against the capitol at Washington, was probably the\n",
      "unauthorized act of private soldiers. Dearborn protested that it was\n",
      "done without his knowledge and against his orders.[166]\n",
      "\n",
      "The success cost far more than it was worth. The explosion of a powder\n",
      "magazine, near which the American advance halted, injured a large\n",
      "number of men on both sides. Not less than three hundred and twenty\n",
      "Americans were killed or wounded in the battle or explosion,[167] or\n",
      "about one fifth of the entire force. General Pike, the best brigadier\n",
      "then in the service, was killed. Only two or three battles in the\n",
      "entire war were equally bloody.[168] “Unfortunately the enemy’s armed\n",
      "ship the ‘Prince Regent,’” reported Dearborn,[169] “left this place for\n",
      "Kingston four days before we arrived.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Chauncey and Dearborn crossed to Niagara, while the troops remained\n",
      "some ten days at York, and we\n",
      "thought that\n",
      "the paid bank capital of the United States did not much exceed sixty\n",
      "millions,[476] and that the notes of these banks in circulation did not\n",
      "reach thirty millions. His estimate of paid bank capital was probably\n",
      "liberal, but his estimate of the circulation was eight or ten millions\n",
      "too small. Had the Treasury been able to count on the use of these\n",
      "resources, they might have answered all necessary purposes; but between\n",
      "the mistakes of the government and the divisions of the people, the\n",
      "Treasury was left with no sound resources whatever.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first and fatal blow to the Treasury was the loss of the Bank\n",
      "of the United States, which left the government without financial\n",
      "machinery or a sound bank-note circulation. The next blow, almost\n",
      "equally severe, was the loss of the Massachusetts and Connecticut\n",
      "banks, which were the strongest in the Union. Whether the\n",
      "responsibility for the loss rested on the Executive, Congress, or the\n",
      "two States might be a subject for dispute; but whoeve\n",
      "ll possibility of exulting in our victories over such an\n",
      "enemy.” The “Times” found in such reflections a reason for not exulting\n",
      "in ministerial victories, but it bewailed defeats the more loudly,\n",
      "and annoyed the Ministry by the violence of its attacks on naval\n",
      "administration.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the year passed, and England’s triumph in Europe seemed to\n",
      "overshadow the world, the “Times,” probably recognizing the uselessness\n",
      "of attacking the Ministry, showed worse temper toward the United\n",
      "States. The Americans were rarely mentioned, and always with language\n",
      "of increasing ill humor. “Despicable in the cabinet, ridiculous in the\n",
      "field,”[461] the Americans disappeared from sight in the splendor of\n",
      "victory at Vittoria and Leipzig. No wish for peace was suggested, and\n",
      "if the “Times” expressed the true feelings of the respectable middle\n",
      "class, as it was supposed to aim at doing, no wish for peace could be\n",
      "supposed to exist.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of the ministerial papers the “Courier” was the best, and of course was\n",
      "emphatic in \n",
      " for its object to dissolve the ties of\n",
      "    allegiance and the sentiments of loyalty in the adversary nation,\n",
      "    and to seduce and separate its component parts the one from the\n",
      "    other. The general tendency of these demoralizing and disorganizing\n",
      "    contrivances will be reprobated by the civilized world.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Although many persons shared Madison’s view of war as a compulsory\n",
      "process of international law, Federalists and Republicans were at a\n",
      "loss to understand his view of “deformity” and “depravity” in modes\n",
      "of warfare. The whole truth in regard to West and East Florida was\n",
      "not known, but so much was notorious, even in 1811, as to warrant the\n",
      "British minister in protesting “against an attempt so contrary to every\n",
      "principle of public justice, faith, and national honor.”[20] What the\n",
      "United States could do in Florida in time of peace, England could\n",
      "surely do in Massachusetts in time of war; but if England’s conduct\n",
      "was in reality deformed and depraved, as charged, the celebrated\n",
      "proclam\n",
      "even more severe; and the total loss in an aggregate which\n",
      "could hardly have numbered much more than eight hundred and fifty men\n",
      "all told, amounted to two hundred and fifty-nine killed, wounded, and\n",
      "missing, leaving Prevost less than six hundred men to escape,[207] in\n",
      "the face of twice their numbers and under the fire of heavy guns.[208]\n",
      "\n",
      "The British attack was repulsed, and Jacob Brown received much credit\n",
      "as well as a commission of brigadier-general in the United States\n",
      "army for his success; but the injury inflicted by the premature\n",
      "destruction at the navy-yard was very great, and was sensibly felt.\n",
      "Such a succession of ill news could not but affect the Government.\n",
      "The repeated failures to destroy the British force at Niagara; the\n",
      "disasters of Chandler, Winder, and Boerstler; the narrow and partial\n",
      "escape of Sackett’s Harbor; the total incapacity of Dearborn caused\n",
      "by fever and mortification,--all these evils were not the only or the\n",
      "greatest subjects for complaint. The two commander\n",
      "pt while the war-fever lasted. Many distinguished\n",
      "statesmen of Europe and America had been, at one time or another, in\n",
      "opposition to some special war,--as was the case with Talleyrand,\n",
      "Charles James Fox, Lord Grey, Jefferson, and Madison; but opposition\n",
      "became unpardonable when it took a form which could have no apparent\n",
      "object except national ruin. The Federalists who held the ideas\n",
      "expressed by the legislature of Massachusetts could explain or defend\n",
      "their future course only by the conviction that the inevitable\n",
      "and long-expected “crisis” was at hand, which must end either in\n",
      "disunion or in reconstruction of the Union on new ground. As “a moral\n",

      "thenceforward, if the Union lasted, could expect no pardon.\n",
      "\n",
      "The extravagance of the Massachusetts Federalists was counterbalanced\n",

Dearborn protested that it was\\ndone without his knowledge and against his orders.[166]\\n\\nThe success cost far more than it was worth. The explosion of a powder\\nmagazine, near which the American advance halted, injured a large\\nnumber of men on both sides. Not less than three hundred and twenty\\nAmericans were killed or wounded in the battle or explosion,[167] or\\nabout one fifth of the entire force. General Pike, the best brigadier\\nthen in the service, was killed. Only two or three battles in the\\nentire war were equally bloody.[168] “Unfortunately the enemy’s armed\\nship the ‘Prince Regent,’” reported Dearborn,[169] “left this place for\\nKingston four days before we arrived.”\\n\\nChauncey and Dearborn crossed to Niagara, while the troops remained\\nsome ten days at York, and we\\nthought that\\nthe paid bank capital of the United States did not much exceed sixty\\nmillions,[476] and that the notes of these banks in circulation did not\\nreach thirty millions. His estimate of paid bank capital was probably\\nliberal, but his estimate of the circulation was eight or ten millions\\ntoo small. Had the Treasury been able to count on the use of these\\nresources, they might have answered all necessary purposes; but between\\nthe mistakes of the government and the divisions of the people, the\\nTreasury was left with no sound resources whatever.\\n\\nThe first and fatal blow to the Treasury was the loss of the Bank\\nof the United States, which left the government without financial\\nmachinery or a sound bank-note circulation. The next blow, almost\\nequally severe, was the loss of the Massachusetts and Connecticut\\nbanks, which were the strongest in the Union.

The whole truth in regard to West and East Florida was\\nnot known, but so much was notorious, even in 1811, as to warrant the\\nBritish minister in protesting “against an attempt so contrary to every\\nprinciple of public justice, faith, and national honor.”[20] What the\\nUnited States could do in Florida in time of peace, England could\\nsurely do in Massachusetts in time of war; but if England’s conduct\\nwas in reality deformed and depraved, as charged, the celebrated\\nproclam\\neven more severe; and the total loss in an aggregate which\\ncould hardly have numbered much more than eight hundred and fifty men\\nall told, amounted to two hundred and fifty-nine killed, wounded, and\\nmissing, leaving Prevost less than six hundred men to escape,[207] in\\nthe face of twice their numbers and under the fire of heavy guns.[208]\\n\\nThe British attack was repulsed, and Jacob Brown received much credit\\nas well as a commission of brigadier-general in the United States\\narmy for his success; but the injury inflicted by the premature\\ndestruction at the navy-yard was very great, and was sensibly felt.\\nSuch a succession of ill news could not but affect the Government.\\nThe repeated failures to destroy the British force at Niagara; the\\ndisasters of Chandler, Winder, and Boerstler; the narrow and partial\\nescape of Sackett’s Harbor; the total incapacity of Dearborn caused\\nby fever and mortification,--all these evils were not the only or the\\ngreatest subjects for complaint.
