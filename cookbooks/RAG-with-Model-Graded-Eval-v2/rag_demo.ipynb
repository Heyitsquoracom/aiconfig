The exports of New York, which exceeded\\n$12,250,000 in 1811, fell to $209,000 for the year ending in 1814.

Toward the close of the year Admiral Warren extended\\nhis blockade eastward. Notice of the extension was given at Halifax\\nNovember 16, and by the blockading squadron off New London December 2,\\nthus closing Long Island Sound to all vessels of every description.[381]\\n\\nThe pressure of the blockade was immediately felt. In August[382]\\nsuperfine flour sold at Boston for $11.87 a barrel, at Baltimore for\\n$6.00, and at Richmond for $4.50. Upland cotton sold at Boston for\\ntwenty cents a pound; at Charleston for nine cents. Rice sold at\\nPhiladelphia for $12.00 a hundred weight; in Charleston and Savannah\\nfor $3.00. Sugar sold in Boston for $18.75 a hundred weight; in\\nBaltimore for $26.50. Already the American staples were unsalable at\\nthe places of their production. No rate of profit could cause cotton,\\nrice, or \\nand supplied the Union\\nwith articles of necessary use at prices practically fixed by her own\\nmanufacturers. From the whole country specie began to flow toward\\nBoston as early as the year 1810, and with astonishing rapidity after\\nthe war was declared. The British blockade stimulated the movement,\\nand the embargo of December, 1813, which lasted till April, 1814, cut\\noff every other resource from the Southern and Western States. Unable\\nlonger to send their crops even to New England for a market, they were\\nobliged to send specie, and they soon came to the end of their supply.\\nThe Massachusetts banks, which reported about $820,000 in specie in\\n1809, returned more than $3,680,000 in June, 1812; which rose to\\n$5,780,000 in June, 1813, and reached nearly $7,000,000 in June, 1814.\\nIn five years the Massachusetts banks alone drew more than six million\\ndollars in specie from the Southern and Middle States,[478] besides\\nwhat they sent to Canada in payment for British bills.\\n\\nNo one knew how much s\\nr was responsible,\\nthe effect was ruinous. The New England banks were financial agents\\nof the enemy. The bank capital of Massachusetts including Maine was\\nabout twelve and a quarter million dollars; that of Connecticut\\nexceeded three millions. The whole bank capital of New England reached\\neighteen millions,[477] or nearly one third of the paid bank capital\\nof the whole country, if Pitkin’s estimate was correct. That nearly\\none third of the national resources should be withdrawn from the aid\\nof government was serious enough; but in reality the loss was much\\ngreater, for New England held a still larger proportion of the specie\\non which the bank circulation of other States depended.\\n\\nThe system of commercial restrictions was responsible for thus, at\\nthe most critical moment of the war, throwing the control of the\\nnational finances into the hands of the Boston Federalists. Against\\nthe protests of the Federalists, manufactures had been forced upon\\nthem by national legislation until New Engl\\nhe\\nrate was about 7.50 per cent. In the end, the government paid 7.487\\nper cent, for the use of these sixteen millions for thirteen years.\\nThe terms were not excessive when it was considered that New England\\nin effect refused to subscribe. Perhaps the loan could not have been\\ntaken at all, had not credit and currency been already expanded to the\\ndanger-point, as the allotment showed; for while New England, where\\nmost of the specie was held, subscribed less than half a million, and\\nBoston took but seventy-five thousand, Pennsylvania, where banking had\\nbecome a frenzy, took seven million dollars. New York and Baltimore\\ntogether contributed only half a million more than was given by\\nPhiladelphia alone. Ten million dollars were taken by Astor, Girard,\\nand Parish,--three foreign-born Americans, without whose aid the money\\ncould not have been obtained on these terms, if at all.

On the other hand, Boston bought freely British Treasury notes\\nat liberal discount, and sent coin to Canada in payment of them.[481]\\nProbably New England lent to the British government during the war more\\nmoney than she lent to her own. The total amount subscribed in New\\nEngland to the United States loans was less than three millions.\\n\\nThis situation was well understood by Congress. In the debate of\\nFebruary, 1814, the approaching dangers were repeatedly pointed out.\\nThe alarm was then so great that the Committee of Ways and Means\\nreported a bill to incorporate a new national bank with a capital of\\nthirty million dollars, while Macon openly advocated the issue of\\ngovernment paper,[482] declaring that “paper money never was beat.”\\nCongress after a diffuse debate passed only a loan bill for twenty-five\\nmill\\npecie the country contained. Gallatin afterward\\nestimated it at seventeen million dollars,[479] and of that amount the\\nbanks of New England in 1814 probably held nearly ten millions. The\\nMassachusetts banks, with seven millions in specie, had a bank-note\\ncirculation of less than three millions. The Middle, Southern, and\\nWestern States must have had a bank-note circulation approaching forty\\nmillions in paper, with seven or eight millions in specie to support\\nit,[480] while the paper was constantly increasing in quantity and the\\nspecie constantly diminishing. Bank paper, as was believed, could not\\nwith safety exceed the proportion of three paper dollars to every\\nspecie dollar in the bank vaults; but the banks in 1814 beyond New\\nEngland were circulating at least four paper dollars to every silver\\nor gold dollar, and in many cases were issuing paper without specie in\\ntheir possession.\\n\\nAlready the banks of New England were pressing their demands on those\\nof New York, which in their turn ca\\nevery moment multiplying. Suffocated with\\nheat, members were forced to sit day by day in the half-finished\\nCapitol, with a Southern village about them, their nearest neighbor a\\nBritish fleet. “Defeated and disgraced everywhere,” said one of the\\nstanchest war members describing the scene, “Congress was to impose the\\nburden of taxes on a divided people, who had been taught by leaders\\nof the war party to look upon a tax-gatherer as a thief, if not to\\nshoot him as a burglar.”[36] According to the same authority, “the\\ncountry was at the lowest point of depression, where fear is too apt to\\nintroduce despair.” In this condition of spirits, Gallatin’s tax-bills\\nwere reported to the House June 10,--measures such as the Republican\\nparty had, till very lately, not conceived as within the range of its\\npossible legislation. They included a direct tax of three million\\ndollars; taxes on salt, licenses, spirits, carriages, auctions, sugar\\nrefineries; a stamp tax, and a complete machinery for the asses\\n27, 1814,[152] when the war\\nhad lasted two years,--\\n\\n    “Two thirds of the army in Canada are at this moment eating beef\\n    provided by American contractors, drawn principally from the States\\n    of Vermont and New York. This circumstance, as well as that of the\\n    introduction of large sums of specie into this province, being\\n    notorious in the United States, it is to be expected Congress\\n    will take steps to deprive us of those resources, and under that\\n    apprehension, large droves are daily crossing the lines coming into\\n    Lower Canada.”\\n\\nThis state of things had then lasted during three campaigns, from\\nthe beginning of the war.

That nearly\\none third of the national resources should be withdrawn from the aid\\nof government was serious enough; but in reality the loss was much\\ngreater, for New England held a still larger proportion of the specie\\non which the bank circulation of other States depended.\\n\\nThe system of commercial restrictions was responsible for thus, at\\nthe most critical moment of the war, throwing the control of the\\nnational finances into the hands of the Boston Federalists. Against\\nthe protests of the Federalists, manufactures had been forced upon\\nthem by national legislation until New Engl\\nhe\\nrate was about 7.50 per cent. In the end, the government paid 7.487\\nper cent, for the use of these sixteen millions for thirteen years.\\nThe terms were not excessive when it was considered that New England\\nin effect refused to subscribe. Perhaps the loan could not have been\\ntaken at all, had not credit and currency been already expanded to the\\ndanger-point, as the allotment showed; for while New England, where\\nmost of the specie was held, subscribed less than half a million, and\\nBoston took but seventy-five thousand, Pennsylvania, where banking had\\nbecome a frenzy, took seven million dollars. New York and Baltimore\\ntogether contributed only half a million more than was given by\\nPhiladelphia alone. Ten million dollars were taken by Astor, Girard,\\nand Parish,--three foreign-born Americans, without whose aid the money\\ncould not have been obtained on these terms, if at all. Doubtless they\\nwere bold operators; but Americans were supposed to be not wanting in\\nthe taste for speculation, and\\n17, 1813; Annals, 1813–1814, p. 2781.\\n\\n[468] Act of Jan. 25, 1814; Annals, 1813–1814, p. 2788.\\n\\n[469] Annals, 1813–1814, p. 1965.\\n\\n[470] Macon to Nicholson, April 6, 1814; Nicholson MSS.\\n\\n[471] Gallatin MSS.\\n\\n[472] Annals, 1813–1814, p. 928.\\n\\n[473] Armstrong to Eppes, Feb. 10, 1814; Niles, vi. 94.\\n\\n[474] Note to abstract of regular troops in service, January, 1814;\\nadjutant-general’s office.

On the other hand, Boston bought freely British Treasury notes\\nat liberal discount, and sent coin to Canada in payment of them.[481]\\nProbably New England lent to the British government during the war more\\nmoney than she lent to her own. The total amount subscribed in New\\nEngland to the United States loans was less than three millions.\\n\\nThis situation was well understood by Congress. In the debate of\\nFebruary, 1814, the approaching dangers were repeatedly pointed out.\\nThe alarm was then so great that the Committee of Ways and Means\\nreported a bill to incorporate a new national bank with a capital of\\nthirty million dollars, while Macon openly advocated the issue of\\ngovernment paper,[482] declaring that “paper money never was beat.”\\nCongress after a diffuse debate passed only a loan bill for twenty-five\\nmill\\npecie the country contained. Gallatin afterward\\nestimated it at seventeen million dollars,[479] and of that amount the\\nbanks of New England in 1814 probably held nearly ten millions. The\\nMassachusetts banks, with seven millions in specie, had a bank-note\\ncirculation of less than three millions. The Middle, Southern, and\\nWestern States must have had a bank-note circulation approaching forty\\nmillions in paper, with seven or eight millions in specie to support\\nit,[480] while the paper was constantly increasing in quantity and the\\nspecie constantly diminishing. Bank paper, as was believed, could not\\nwith safety exceed the proportion of three paper dollars to every\\nspecie dollar in the bank vaults; but the banks in 1814 beyond New\\nEngland were circulating at least four paper dollars to every silver\\nor gold dollar, and in many cases were issuing paper without specie in\\ntheir possession.\\n\\nAlready the banks of New England were pressing their demands on those\\nof New York, which in their turn ca\\nevery moment multiplying. Suffocated with\\nheat, members were forced to sit day by day in the half-finished\\nCapitol, with a Southern village about them, their nearest neighbor a\\nBritish fleet. “Defeated and disgraced everywhere,” said one of the\\nstanchest war members describing the scene, “Congress was to impose the\\nburden of taxes on a divided people, who had been taught by leaders\\nof the war party to look upon a tax-gatherer as a thief, if not to\\nshoot him as a burglar.”[36] According to the same authority, “the\\ncountry was at the lowest point of depression, where fear is too apt to\\nintroduce despair.” In this condition of spirits, Gallatin’s tax-bills\\nwere reported to the House June 10,--measures such as the Republican\\nparty had, till very lately, not conceived as within the range of its\\npossible legislation. They included a direct tax of three million\\ndollars; taxes on salt, licenses, spirits, carriages, auctions, sugar\\nrefineries; a stamp tax, and a complete machinery for the asses\\n27, 1814,[152] when the war\\nhad lasted two years,--\\n\\n    “Two thirds of the army in Canada are at this moment eating beef\\n    provided by American contractors, drawn principally from the States\\n    of Vermont and New York. This circumstance, as well as that of the\\n    introduction of large sums of specie into this province, being\\n    notorious in the United States, it is to be expected Congress\\n    will take steps to deprive us of those resources, and under that\\n    apprehension, large droves are daily crossing the lines coming into\\n    Lower Canada.”\\n\\nThis state of things had then lasted during three campaigns, from\\nthe beginning of the war. The Indians at Malden, the British army at\\nNiagara, the naval station at Kingston were largely fed by the United\\nStates. If these supplies could be stopped, Upper Canada must probably\\nfall; and they could be easily stopped by interrupting the British line\\nof transport anywhere on the St. Lawrence.\\n\\nThe task was not difficult.

The British blockade stimulated the movement,\\nand the embargo of December, 1813, which lasted till April, 1814, cut\\noff every other resource from the Southern and Western States. Unable\\nlonger to send their crops even to New England for a market, they were\\nobliged to send specie, and they soon came to the end of their supply.\\nThe Massachusetts banks, which reported about $820,000 in specie in\\n1809, returned more than $3,680,000 in June, 1812; which rose to\\n$5,780,000 in June, 1813, and reached nearly $7,000,000 in June, 1814.\\nIn five years the Massachusetts banks alone drew more than six million\\ndollars in specie from the Southern and Middle States,[478] besides\\nwhat they sent to Canada in payment for British bills.\\n\\nNo one knew how much s\\nr was responsible,\\nthe effect was ruinous. The New England banks were financial agents\\nof the enemy. The bank capital of Massachusetts including Maine was\\nabout twelve and a quarter million dollars; that of Connecticut\\nexceeded three millions. The whole bank capital of New England reached\\neighteen millions,[477] or nearly one third of the paid bank capital\\nof the whole country, if Pitkin’s estimate was correct. That nearly\\none third of the national resources should be withdrawn from the aid\\nof government was serious enough; but in reality the loss was much\\ngreater, for New England held a still larger proportion of the specie\\non which the bank circulation of other States depended.\\n\\nThe system of commercial restrictions was responsible for thus, at\\nthe most critical moment of the war, throwing the control of the\\nnational finances into the hands of the Boston Federalists. Against\\nthe protests of the Federalists, manufactures had been forced upon\\nthem by national legislation until New Engl\\nhe\\nrate was about 7.50 per cent. In the end, the government paid 7.487\\nper cent, for the use of these sixteen millions for thirteen years.\\nThe terms were not excessive when it was considered that New England\\nin effect refused to subscribe. Perhaps the loan could not have been\\ntaken at all, had not credit and currency been already expanded to the\\ndanger-point, as the allotment showed; for while New England, where\\nmost of the specie was held, subscribed less than half a million, and\\nBoston took but seventy-five thousand, Pennsylvania, where banking had\\nbecome a frenzy, took seven million dollars. New York and Baltimore\\ntogether contributed only half a million more than was given by\\nPhiladelphia alone. Ten million dollars were taken by Astor, Girard,\\nand Parish,--three foreign-born Americans, without whose aid the money\\ncould not have been obtained on these terms, if at all. Doubtless they\\nwere bold operators; but Americans were supposed to be not wanting in\\nthe taste for speculation, and\\n17, 1813; Annals, 1813–1814, p. 2781.\\n\\n[468] Act of Jan. 25, 1814; Annals, 1813–1814, p. 2788.\\n\\n[469] Annals, 1813–1814, p. 1965.\\n\\n[470] Macon to Nicholson, April 6, 1814; Nicholson MSS.\\n\\n[471] Gallatin MSS.\\n\\n[472] Annals, 1813–1814, p. 928.\\n\\n[473] Armstrong to Eppes, Feb. 10, 1814; Niles, vi. 94.\\n\\n[474] Note to abstract of regular troops in service, January, 1814;\\nadjutant-general’s office.

On the other hand, Boston bought freely British Treasury notes\\nat liberal discount, and sent coin to Canada in payment of them.[481]\\nProbably New England lent to the British government during the war more\\nmoney than she lent to her own. The total amount subscribed in New\\nEngland to the United States loans was less than three millions.\\n\\nThis situation was well understood by Congress. In the debate of\\nFebruary, 1814, the approaching dangers were repeatedly pointed out.\\nThe alarm was then so great that the Committee of Ways and Means\\nreported a bill to incorporate a new national bank with a capital of\\nthirty million dollars, while Macon openly advocated the issue of\\ngovernment paper,[482] declaring that “paper money never was beat.”\\nCongress after a diffuse debate passed only a loan bill for twenty-five\\nmill\\npecie the country contained. Gallatin afterward\\nestimated it at seventeen million dollars,[479] and of that amount the\\nbanks of New England in 1814 probably held nearly ten millions. The\\nMassachusetts banks, with seven millions in specie, had a bank-note\\ncirculation of less than three millions. The Middle, Southern, and\\nWestern States must have had a bank-note circulation approaching forty\\nmillions in paper, with seven or eight millions in specie to support\\nit,[480] while the paper was constantly increasing in quantity and the\\nspecie constantly diminishing. Bank paper, as was believed, could not\\nwith safety exceed the proportion of three paper dollars to every\\nspecie dollar in the bank vaults; but the banks in 1814 beyond New\\nEngland were circulating at least four paper dollars to every silver\\nor gold dollar, and in many cases were issuing paper without specie in\\ntheir possession.\\n\\nAlready the banks of New England were pressing their demands on those\\nof New York, which in their turn ca\\nevery moment multiplying. Suffocated with\\nheat, members were forced to sit day by day in the half-finished\\nCapitol, with a Southern village about them, their nearest neighbor a\\nBritish fleet. “Defeated and disgraced everywhere,” said one of the\\nstanchest war members describing the scene, “Congress was to impose the\\nburden of taxes on a divided people, who had been taught by leaders\\nof the war party to look upon a tax-gatherer as a thief, if not to\\nshoot him as a burglar.”[36] According to the same authority, “the\\ncountry was at the lowest point of depression, where fear is too apt to\\nintroduce despair.” In this condition of spirits, Gallatin’s tax-bills\\nwere reported to the House June 10,--measures such as the Republican\\nparty had, till very lately, not conceived as within the range of its\\npossible legislation. They included a direct tax of three million\\ndollars; taxes on salt, licenses, spirits, carriages, auctions, sugar\\nrefineries; a stamp tax, and a complete machinery for the asses\\n27, 1814,[152] when the war\\nhad lasted two years,--\\n\\n    “Two thirds of the army in Canada are at this moment eating beef\\n    provided by American contractors, drawn principally from the States\\n    of Vermont and New York. This circumstance, as well as that of the\\n    introduction of large sums of specie into this province, being\\n    notorious in the United States, it is to be expected Congress\\n    will take steps to deprive us of those resources, and under that\\n    apprehension, large droves are daily crossing the lines coming into\\n    Lower Canada.”\\n\\nThis state of things had then lasted during three campaigns, from\\nthe beginning of the war. The Indians at Malden, the British army at\\nNiagara, the naval station at Kingston were largely fed by the United\\nStates. If these supplies could be stopped, Upper Canada must probably\\nfall; and they could be easily stopped by interrupting the British line\\nof transport anywhere on the St. Lawrence.\\n\\nThe task was not difficult.

The idea that England could be distressed by an embargo\\nseemed still less likely to influence Government. Congress knew that\\nRussia, Prussia, Denmark, Sweden and Norway, Spain, and South America\\nwere already open to English commerce, and that a few days must decide\\nwhether Napoleon could much longer prevent Great Britain from trading\\nwith France. The possibility of distressing England by closing Boston\\nand Salem, New Bedford and Newport to neutral ships was not to be\\nseriously treated.\\n\\nWhatever was the true motive of the President’s recommendation,\\nCongress instantly approved it. The next day, December 10, the Hou\\nculty in obtaining it; but he would hardly have arranged a system\\nof signals as visible to Decatur as to himself. Even had he done so, he\\nmight have employed men in his own service as well as Americans for the\\npurpose. Decatur’s letter admitted that he had made great exertions to\\ndetect the culprits, but without success.\\n\\nThe rigor of the British blockade extended no farther north than\\nthe Vineyard and Nantucket. Captain Broke in the “Shannon,” with a\\ncompanion frigate, cruised off Boston harbor rather to watch for\\nships-of-war than to interfere with neutral commerce. Along the coast\\nof Maine an illicit trade with the British provinces was so actively\\npursued that one of the few American sloops-of-war, the “Enterprise,”\\ncruised there, holding smugglers, privateers, and petty marauders in\\ncheck. On no other portion of the coast would an armed national vessel\\nhave been allowed to show itself, but the “Enterprise,” protected\\nby the bays and inlets of Maine, and favored by the absence of a\\nst India colonies were kept in constant discomfort and starvation\\nby swarms of semi-piratical craft darting in and out of every channel\\namong their islands; but the people of England could have borne with\\npatience the punishment of the West Indies had not the American\\ncruisers inflicted equally severe retribution nearer home.\\n\\nGreat Britain was blockaded. No one could deny that manifest danger\\nexisted to any merchant-vessel that entered or left British waters.\\nDuring the summer the blockade was continuous. Toward the close of\\n1812 an American named Preble, living in Paris, bought a small vessel,\\nsaid to have belonged in turn to the British and French navy, which\\nhe fitted as a privateer-brig, carrying sixteen guns and one hundred\\nand sixty men. The “True-Blooded Yankee,” commanded by Captain Hailey,\\nsailed from Brest March 1, 1813, and cruised thirty-seven days on\\nthe coasts of Ireland and Scotland, capturing twenty-seven valuable\\nvessels; sinking coasters in the very bay of Dublin; la\\ns probably the\\nleast adapted to negotiation, but while England was at the moment of\\nher most extravagant sense of power, President Madison received and\\naccepted Castlereagh’s offer to negotiate, and Gallatin went with\\nBayard to London to hasten the approach of peace.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XV.\\n\\n\\nCONGRESS assembled Dec. 6, 1813, at a time of general perplexity.\\nThe victories of Perry and Harrison, September 10 and October 5, had\\nrecovered Detroit and even conquered a part of West Canada, but their\\nsuccesses were already dimmed by the failures of Wilkinson and Hampton\\nbefore Montreal, and the retreat of both generals November 13 within\\nUnited States territory. In the Creek country the Georgians had failed\\nto advance from the east, and Jackson was stopped at Fort Strother\\nby want of supplies and men. At sea the navy was doing little, while\\nthe British blockade from New London southward was becoming more and\\nmore ruinous to the Southern and Middle States, and through them to\\nthe government.
