October 23 he\\\\nbegan his retreat; November 23 he succeeded in crossing the Beresina\\\\nand escaping capture; December 5 he abandoned what was still left of\\\\nhis army; and December 19, after travelling secretly and without rest\\\\nacross Europe, he appeared suddenly in Paris, still powerful, but in\\\\ndanger. Nothing could be better calculated to support the Russian\\\\nmediation in the President’s mind. The possibility of remaining without\\\\na friend in the world while carrying on a war without hope of success,\\\\ngave to the Czar’s friendship a value altogether new.\\\\n\\\\nOther news crossed the ocean at the same time, but encouraged no hope\\\\nthat England would give way. First in importance, and not to be trifled\\\\nwith, was the British official announcement, dated December 26, 1812,\\\\nof the blockade of the Chesapeake and Delaware. Americans held that\\\\nthis blockade was illegal,[18]--a blockade of a coast, not of a port; a\\\\npaper-', ' the Indian signers to declare war on the British.\\\\nNeither Harrison’s nor Jackson’s treaty embraced the chief body of\\\\nhostile Indians; but Harrison’s treaty served another purpose of no\\\\nsmall value in appearing to remove an obstacle to negotiation with\\\\nEngland.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCHAPTER XI.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBADLY as the United States fared in the campaign of 1813, their\\\\nsituation would have been easy had they not suffered under the\\\\nannoyances of a blockade continually becoming more stringent. The\\\\ndoctrine that coasts could be blockaded was enforced against America\\\\nwith an energy that fell little short of demonstration. The summer was\\\\nwell advanced before the whole naval force to be used for the purpose\\\\ncould be posted at the proper stations. Not until May 26 did Admiral\\\\nWarren issue at Bermuda his proclamation of “a strict and rigorous\\\\nblockade of the ports and harbors of New York, Charleston, Port Royal,\\\\nSavannah, and of the river Mississippi,” which completed the blockade\\\\nof the coast, leaving only the ports of ', 'blockade, one of the grievances against which the war was waged;\\\\nbut whatever they might choose to call it, they could not successfully\\\\ndisprove its efficiency, or deny that it made Chesapeake Bay, Delaware\\\\nRiver, and the Vineyard Sound little better than British waters. Export\\\\nof American produce from the Chesapeake and Delaware ceased.\\\\n\\\\nThe blockade, though serious beyond all other military measures,\\\\nroused less attention and less protest than another measure of the\\\\nBritish government which had the character of a profitable insult. A\\\\ncircular dated November 9, addressed to the governors of West Indian\\\\ncolonies by the British government, authorized them to issue licenses\\\\nfor importation of necessary supplies during the war,--a precaution\\\\ncommonly taken to meet the risk of famine in those regions. The\\\\nGovernor of the Bermudas, in issuing a proclamation January 14, 1813,\\\\npublished the circular, which contained one unusual provision:[19]--\\\\n\\\\n    “Whatever importations are proposed to be m', ' nor any\\\\nmeasures that could be taken by sea or land, prevented a constant\\\\ntraffic between Halifax and the New England ports not blockaded. The\\\\nUnited States government seemed afraid to interfere with it. The\\\\nnewspapers asserted that hundreds of Americans were actually in Halifax\\\\ncarrying on a direct trade, and that thousands of barrels of flour were\\\\nconstantly arriving there from the United States in vessels carrying\\\\nthe Swedish or other neutral flag. In truth the government could do\\\\nlittle to enforce its non-intercourse, and even that little might prove\\\\nmischievous. Nothing could be worse than the spirit of the people on\\\\nthe frontier. Engaged in a profitable illicit commerce, they could only\\\\nbe controlled by force, and any force not overwhelming merely provoked\\\\nviolence or treason. The Navy Department had no vessels to send there,\\\\nand could not have prevented their capture if vessels in any number had\\\\nbeen sent. The Secretary of War had abandoned to the State governments\\\\nthe defence ', ' ruining the peasantry. We drive all their cattle, and of\\\\ncourse ruin them. _My_ hands are clean; but it is hateful to see the\\\\npoor Yankees robbed, and to be the robber.”\\\\n\\\\nCompared with the widespread destruction which war brought on these\\\\nregions half a century afterward, the injury inflicted by the British\\\\nnavy in 1813 was trifling, but it served to annoy the Southern\\\\npeople, who could offer no resistance, and were harassed by incessant\\\\nmilitia-calls. To some extent the same system of vexation was pursued\\\\non the Northern coast. The Delaware River was blockaded and its\\\\nshores much annoyed. New York was also blockaded, and Nantucket with\\\\nthe adjacent Sounds became a British naval station. There Sir Thomas\\\\nHardy, Nelson’s favorite, officer, commanded, in his flag-ship the\\\\n“Ramillies.” Hardy did not encourage marauding such as Cockburn\\\\npractised, but his blockade was still stringent, and its efficiency was\\\\nproved by the failure of Decatur’s efforts to evade it.\\\\n\\\\nDecatur commanded a squad', 'ed States outside of New England did\\\\nnot exceed $150,000 a month, or at the rate of $1,800,000 a year.[384]\\\\n\\\\nNo ordinary operations of war could affect the United States so\\\\nseverely as this inexorable blockade. Every citizen felt it in every\\\\naction of his life. The farmer grew crops which he could not sell,\\\\nwhile he paid tenfold prices for every necessity. While the country\\\\nwas bursting with wealth, it was ruined. The blockade was but a part\\\\nof the evil. The whole coast was systematically swept of the means of\\\\nindustry. Especially the Virginians and Marylanders felt the heavy hand\\\\nof England as it was felt nowhere else except on the Niagara River. A\\\\nlarge British squadron occupied Chesapeake Bay, and converted it into\\\\na British naval station. After the month of February, 1813, the coasts\\\\nof Virginia and Maryland enjoyed not a moment’s repose. Considering the\\\\nimmense naval power wielded by England, the Americans were fortunate\\\\nthat their chief losses were confined to the farm-yards and ', 'n be given to it.”\\\\n\\\\nAlthough Madison pointed to the notorious supply of food for the\\\\nBritish forces in Canada as one of the motives for imposing an embargo,\\\\nno one supposed that motive to be decisive. Other laws already forbade\\\\nand punished such communication with the enemy; and experience proved\\\\nthat a general embargo would be no more effective than any special\\\\nprohibition. The idea that England could be distressed by an embargo\\\\nseemed still less likely to influence Government. Congress knew that\\\\nRussia, Prussia, Denmark, Sweden and Norway, Spain, and South America\\\\nwere already open to English commerce, and that a few days must decide\\\\nwhether Napoleon could much longer prevent Great Britain from trading\\\\nwith France. The possibility of distressing England by closing Boston\\\\nand Salem, New Bedford and Newport to neutral ships was not to be\\\\nseriously treated.\\\\n\\\\nWhatever was the true motive of the President’s recommendation,\\\\nCongress instantly approved it.
