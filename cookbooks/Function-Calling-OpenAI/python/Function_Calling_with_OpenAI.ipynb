        "This notebook serves as a practical guide for leveraging AIConfig and function calling with OpenAI models. We start with a mock database of books and functions to list, search, and retrieve books. Function calling is enabled so the LLM can interpret a user's question, determine the appropriate function to call, and execute the function. Read more about [Function Calling with Open AI](https://openai.com/blog/function-calling-and-other-api-updates) and [AIConfig for prompt and model management](https://github.com/lastmile-ai/aiconfig)."
