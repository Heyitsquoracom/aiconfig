The story follows the life of Kya Clark, a young woman who has lived in the marsh for most of her life and is often ostracized by the community. As a naturalist, Kya learned to survive in the wild by observing the world around her, but when a popular young man Chase Andrews is found dead, she becomes the suspect. As she navigates the complex relationships with two other young men, Kya opens herself up to a new world and experiences love, but faces unimaginable tragedy as the story unfolds. The themes of the book, such as survival, love, and identity, make it a thought-provoking read that will stay with you long after you've finished it."
