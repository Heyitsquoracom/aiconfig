# Welcome to AIConfig Editor!

AIConfig Editor is a tool that allows you to **create, edit, and manage AIConfig files**. This acts as an open-source playground that supports local and remote models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, Google, HuggingFace, Anyscale, and more.  
**Tip:** To learn more about AIConfigs and why they're useful, check out the FAQ section at the bottom of this page.

## Commands

Get started by trying out some of these commands! Press ("CMD" + "SHIFT" + P) to open the command palette and type in "AIConfig":

<!-- Not able to get below line to work for executing VSCode Command -->
<!-- - [`AIConfig: Create New`](command:vscode-aiconfig.createAIConfigJSON) -> Creates a new file (in JSON or YAML format) -->

- `AIConfig: Create New` -> Creates a new file (in JSON or YAML format)
- `AIConfig: Share (get permalink)` -> Creates a link to read-only state of your AIConfig file. Use this to share with others :D
- `AIConfig: Welcome` -> Opens this window that you can refer to again!

You can also open existing files that end in ".aiconfig.json" or ".aiconfig.yaml" (note that there are two periods in the filename!).  
Example: "my_cool_file.aiconfig.json"

## API Keys

Some models require API keys in order to run them. If you want to run any of the models below, please create a ".env" file in the root of your project and add the following keys:

- [GOOGLE_API_KEY](https://ai.google.dev/tutorials/setup)\=your_key_here
  - Used for Gemini
- [OPENAI_API_KEY](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)\=your_key_here
  - Used for OpenAI models like ChatGPT and Dall-E
- [HUGGING_FACE_API_TOKEN](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)\=your_token_here
  - Used for any models [hosted on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/models)

For example, your .env file should look similar to this: ![Example .env file](https://s3.amazonaws.com/lastmileai.aiconfig.public/api_key_example.png)

# FAQ / Troubleshooting

Whenever you encounter errors, they should show up in the Output channel. Access it by following these steps:

1.  Press keys "CMD" + "Shift" + P
2.  Type and enter "Output: Show Output Channels"
3.  Type and enter "AIConfig"

**Q: I'm seeing a blank page when I run "AIConfig: Create New"**  
A: This likely means either:

1.  Missing or outdated python modules
    - Make sure you're on version >= 0.0.6 for AIConfig Editor extension
    - Type `pip3 list | grep aiconfig` in terminal and make sure you have `python-aiconfig` >= 1.1.22. If it's not on >=1.1.22, run `pip3 install python-aiconfig --force-reinstall`
    - Check the output channel for more info (see instructions at beginning of "FAQ / Troubleshooting")
2.  You are running AIConfig Editor with the wrong Python interpreter
    - Make sure you have Python >=3.10 installed
    - After you try to create a new file, and viewing blank screen, open command palette ("CMD" + "SHIFT" + P) and run the command `AIConfig: Initialize Extension` to ensure everything is properly configured

**Q: Got this error: "Failed to start aiconfig server. You can view the aiconfig but cannot modify it."**  
A: This can happen when trying to open a config file. You can usually fix this by:

1.  Re-opening the file
    - If you still see this error but the file opens and works, you can ignore this for now
2.  Running the steps to make sure your Python pacakges are properly initialized and up-to-date
    - Follow instructions for "I'm seeing a blank page" issue from above

**Q: What is AIConfig?**  
A: AIConfig files are files in JSON or YAML format where you can define the structure of generative AI workflows. Each AIConfig file contains a set of prompts which define what AI model to use and what data (ex: input settings, prompt parameters) to pass into the model when calling it. It also contains the output for that call if it exists. AIConfigs are pretty gnarley because they let you:

1.  Use any model
    - OpenAI: ChatGPT and Dall-E
    - Google: Gemini
    - Anthropic: Claude
    - HuggingFace: Text-to-Image, Image-to-Text, Automatic Speech Recognition, Text-to-Speech, etc.
    - and many more!
2.  Chain prompts together
    - You can use the output of one prompt as the input to another
3.  Decouple AI configuration from application code
    - Normally if you want to use AI model APIs in code, you need to call into them directly. But with AIConfig, that's all handled for you, so you only need to use [2 lines in your application code](https://aiconfig.lastmileai.dev/docs/gradio-workbook#build-apps-inspired-by-spaces) to get the results you need
