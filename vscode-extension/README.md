# AIConfig Extension for Visual Studio Code

This extension turns VSCode into a generative AI prompt IDE. It provides a notebook editor to run inference for various model providers, including OpenAI, Hugging Face, Google (Gemini), Meta (llama), Anyscale (mixtral and llama) and others.

The editor is backed by [`aiconfig`](https://github.com/lastmile-ai/aiconfig), which is a JSON/YAML-based format for storing prompts and model generation settings.
