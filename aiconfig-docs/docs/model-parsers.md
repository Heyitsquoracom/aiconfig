# Supported Models

`aiconfig` is designed to be model-agnostic and multi-modal, allowing it to work with any model from any provider. For more information on how this works, please see [Extensibility](/docs/extensibility)

## Default Models

`aiconfig` ships with out-of-the-box support for a limited number of models.

:::info
We plan on keeping core `aiconfig` lightweight so it doesn't become a monolithic project. Instead, AIConfig extensions should be created and shared to support additional models and functionality. See
